# Challenge 1
# Write a script that creates a 15,000-meter buffer around features in the
# airports.shp feature class classified as an airport ( based on the FEATURE
# field ) and a 7,500-meter buffer around features classified as a seaplane
# base. The results should be two separate feature classes, one for each
# airport type.

for fc in fc_list:

  print "{0} is a {1} feature class".format(desc.basename, desc.shapeType)

# Challenge 2
# Write a script that adds a text field to the roads.shp feature class called
# FERRY and populates this field with YES and NO values, depending on
# the value of the FEATURE field.
